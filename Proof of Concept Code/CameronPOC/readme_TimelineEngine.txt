This python code is built for python 3. 
The code requires the following libraries to run:
1. Wikipedia
2. Numpy
3. JSON
4. gensim

The current version does some basic NLP text summarization on the wiki content for a particular location.

To test the Timeline Engine, place it in the same directory as the RequestEmulator.py and run 'python RequestEmulator.py'
The current output is simply the pre-processed text that will be fed to the summary generation.
