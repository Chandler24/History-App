      "body" : "Not a fan. The renovation has gone too low into the bowl on one side and looks ridiculous. It will block thousands of seats. Yes, the entire Stadium is in need of a renovation but with the Olympics on the way they'll have to rip up the new seats again to get the track in, very strange. They should have done what Michigan Stadium done and build the corporate, premium and media areas at the top of the Bowl along the sidelines."
